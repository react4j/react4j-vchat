# TODO

This document is essentially a list of shorthand notes describing work yet to be completed.
Unfortunately it is not complete enough for other people to pick work off the list and
complete as there is too much un-said.

## Shortlist Actions

* Add the ability to manually select active stream or else follow audio activity.
  Follow audio activity - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16724414/microphone-activity-level-of-webrtc-mediastream
* Add an icon to small video lists to indicate which ones have no audio component
* Make sure the enable/disable of video/audio re-negotiates the session
* Fix styling on lower panels
* Fix all the TODOs
* Add hangup button
* Add fullscreen toggle button

---

* Asses `RTCStatsReport` maplike interface to ensure we are generating it correctly.
