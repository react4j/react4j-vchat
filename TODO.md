# TODO

This document is essentially a list of shorthand notes describing work yet to be completed.
Unfortunately it is not complete enough for other people to pick work off the list and
complete as there is too much un-said.

## Shortlist Actions

* Add the ability to manually select active stream or else follow audio activity.
  Follow audio activity - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16724414/microphone-activity-level-of-webrtc-mediastream
* Fix styling on lower panels
* Fix all the TODOs
* Consider rewriting a peer abstraction to ensure renegotiation works as expected.
  See https://github.com/feross/simple-peer/blob/master/index.js for a possible solution.
* Consider copying logic from https://github.com/vasanthv/talk/blob/master/www/script.js
